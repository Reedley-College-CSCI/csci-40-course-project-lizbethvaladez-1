 * Description:
 * A music library program where users can add or remove songs that are read and stored on a file. 
 * A menu will give options to add, remove, search, and sort the library. The search will be through song names
 * and artists. There will be options to sort by name and artist. 
 * (WIP) There will be an option to create playlists from the main music library, potentially using pointers
 * to add the songs from the library
